create deploy-chatui.sh file that will just deploy the genai services needed for the chat ui. 
To be clear we will have a deploy.sh that deploys any db and app then a deploy-chatui.sh that deploys the genai bicep files, this mens the chatui can be optionally deployed after the main deployment.
Make sure the deploy-chatui file sets the environment variables from the genai resources created earlier:

  OPENAI_ENDPOINT=$(echo $DEPLOYMENT_OUTPUT | jq -r '.openAIEndpoint.value')
  OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=$(echo $DEPLOYMENT_OUTPUT | jq -r '.openAIModelName.value')
  SEARCH_ENDPOINT=$(echo $DEPLOYMENT_OUTPUT | jq -r '.searchEndpoint.value')
